                        players ever, but just the ones that I've enjoyed watching
                        the most over the years. Click on one of the buttons above to 
                        see details on that player!

                <h2>Nikola Jokić</h2>
                <article class="player-details">
                    <p>
                        Nikola Jokić was drafted in 2014 by the Denver Nuggets, and
                        has continued to play for the team ever since. Standing at
                        6'11", this big man can do it all. He has excellent court
                        vision allowing him to make great plays to his teammates, and 
                        is also very cabable of scoring, and rebounding due to his
                        height. Along with being an incredible basketball player,
                        Nikola Jokić has a great sense of humor. Watching his interviews
                        always cracks me up. Jokić has won 1 Playoff Championship
                        in the 2023 playoffs.

                        Kyrie Irving has always been an extremely fun player to watch and is often considered one of if not the greatest ball-handler of all time. Iriving was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2011, and has since played on several other teams. Just as of 2023, Kyrie Irving is now playing on the Dallas Mavericks. Irving has one 1 championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2016 Playoffs.

                    <p>
                        Kobe Bryant is a true Basketball legend and is considered one of the greatest to ever play the game. Kobe was drafted in 1996 by the Los Angeles Lakers and spent his entire 20-year career with the team. During this time, he won a whopping 5 Playoff Championships, and was awarded the Finals MVP for 2 of those. Kobe tragically died in a helicopter crash on January 26, 2020, but the legacy that he has left for basketball players and fans alike will never be forgotten.
